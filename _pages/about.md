Hello, I’m **Yuxin Chen**. I’m a master’s student in [Department of Communication and Media Research (IKMZ)](https://www.ikmz.uzh.ch/en.html), University of Zurich, supervised by [Prof. Tobias Dienlin](https://www.ikmz.uzh.ch/en/research/divisions/mediapsychology-and-methods/team/tobias-dienlin.html) and [Dr. Nicole Bizzotto](https://www.ikmz.uzh.ch/en/research/divisions/mediapsychology-and-methods/team/nicole-bizzotto.html). Before coming to IKMZ, I earned my B.A. with distinction from [Shanghai International Studies University](https://en.shisu.edu.cn/). 

My research focuses on **emerging technologies** and **health communication** with a **quantitative approach** (survey, experiment, and experience sampling method). I’m currently interested in: (1) how emerging technologies, such as AI chatbots, can be utilized for health interventions (2) the development of online mental health tools based on uncertainty management. You can learn more about my research in the [Research Works](https://yuxin2003.github.io/research/) page.

My work has published in *Computers in Human Behavior Reports*, and at conferences, such as the annual conference of the International Communication Association (*ICA*).
