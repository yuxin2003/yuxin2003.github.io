Hello, I'm Yuxin. I'm a master's student in [Institute of Communication and Media Research (IKMZ)](https://www.ikmz.uzh.ch/en.html), University of Zurich. Before coming to IKMZ, I earned my B.A. with distinction from [Shanghai International Studies University](https://en.shisu.edu.cn/).

My research focuses on emerging technology and well-being. I specialize in the use of quantitative methods (survey, experiment, and experience sampling method). You can learn more about my research in the [Research Works](https://yuxin2003.github.io/research/) page.
