My research focuses on emerging technologies and health communication with a quantitative approach (survey, experiment, and experience sampling method). I’m currently interested in: (1) how emerging technologies, such as AI chatbots, can be utilized for health interventions; and (2) the impact of daily social media use on mental health. 

I'm happy to receive invitations for collaboration related to my research. Please contact me via email.
