My research focuses on emerging technologies and well-being. Specifically, I'm currently interested in (1) how emerging technologies, such as AI and the Internet, can be utilized for health interventions and (2) the development of online mental health tools based on uncertainty management. I specialize in the use of quantitative methods (survey, experiment, and experience sampling method).

I'm happy to receive invitations for collaboration related to my research. Please contact me via email.
