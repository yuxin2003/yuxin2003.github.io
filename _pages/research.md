Obtaining high-quality information is the most important motivation, while another one comes from the emotional connection.

* The Paper FactCheck: Traceability, Verification and Reporting of Unverified Information in Social Media
  * 04/2022 – 10/2022
  * In more than six months of fact-checking, I verified hundreds of claims and prevented the spread of misinformation. My work reduced the impact of misinformation on people during the outbreak. While completing my fact-checking work, I conducted two lectures on fact-checking skills. To this day, a number of students continue their fact-checking work under my guidance.

* Comparative Effectiveness of Substituted Factual and Credibility Indicators in Blocking and Correcting Misinformation Related to the COVID-19 Epidemic
  * 03/2022 - 06/2022
  * This study used quantitative experiments to compare two academically recognized  blocking strategies. The conclusion shows that the blocking effect of substitutable facts is significantly better than providing credibility indicators. Meanwhile, when the two are used at the same time, they show a stronger blocking effect and mutual regulation.
