* From Information Seeking to Body Image Anxiety: Exploring the Underlying Mechanisms
  * 06/2023 - 05/2024
  * This study identified information-seeking orientation as a critical precursor to the dynamic of social media engagement leading to body image anxiety. It also applied the tolerance of uncertainty to the context of social media engagement and body image, demonstrating that individuals with a higher tolerance of uncertainty may experience less anxiety despite higher levels of engagement. We identify tolerance for uncertainty as a new psychological factor in social media engagement leading to body image anxiety.

* The Paper FactCheck: Traceability, Verification and Reporting of Unverified Information in Social Media
  * 04/2022 â€“ 10/2022
  * In more than six months of fact-checking work, I checked hundreds of messages on social media and prevented the spread of misinformation. While completing my fact-checking work, I conducted two lectures on fact-checking skills. To this day, a number of students continue their fact-checking work under my tutorship.

* Comparative Effectiveness of Substituted Fact and Credibility Indicator in Blocking Misinformation Related to the COVID-19 Epidemic
  * 03/2022 - 06/2022
  * This study used quantitative experiments to compare two academically recognized  blocking strategies. The conclusion shows that the blocking effect of substituted facts is significantly better than providing credibility indicators. Meanwhile, when the two are used at the same time, they show a stronger additive effect.
